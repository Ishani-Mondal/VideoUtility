1
00:00:00,039 --> 00:00:03,749
Three reasons why we should continue
using nuclear energy.

2
00:00:04,269 --> 00:00:07,203
One: nuclear energy saves lives.

3
00:00:07,533 --> 00:00:12,862
In 2013, a study conducted by NASA found
that nuclear energy has prevented

4
00:00:12,862 --> 00:00:15,302
around 1.8 million deaths.

5
00:00:15,422 --> 00:00:18,555
Even if you include the death tolls from
Chernobyl and Fukushima,

6
00:00:18,555 --> 00:00:23,439
nuclear energy ranks last in death per
energy unit produced.

7
00:00:23,809 --> 00:00:28,082
While nuclear waste is really toxic,
it’s usually stored somewhere,

8
00:00:28,082 --> 00:00:32,227
while the toxic byproducts of fossil fuels
are pumped into the air

9
00:00:32,227 --> 00:00:33,462
we breathe every day.

10
00:00:33,872 --> 00:00:38,679
So, just by reducing the amount of fossil
fuels burned, countless cases of cancer

11
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:42,163
or lung disease and accidents in
coal mines have been avoided.

12
00:00:42,592 --> 00:00:46,730
If we can choose between lots of dangerous
stuff being put into a deep hole and

13
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,798
lots and lots and lots of dangerous stuff
being pumped into the atmosphere,

14
00:00:50,798 --> 00:00:52,961
the former seems more logical.

15
00:00:53,271 --> 00:00:55,944
Nuclear energy feels way
more dangerous, though.

16
00:00:56,224 --> 00:01:01,459
Single catastrophic events burn into our
memory, while coal and oil kill silently.

17
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:04,723
It’s like the death rate of
flying versus driving.

18
00:01:05,243 --> 00:01:08,860
Even in the best-case scenario, it would
take at least forty years to switch

19
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,109
to 100%-renewable energy.

20
00:01:11,589 --> 00:01:16,552
So, for as long as we continue using
fossil fuels, nuclear energy will save

21
00:01:16,552 --> 00:01:18,384
way more lives than it destroys.

22
00:01:19,164 --> 00:01:22,565
Two: nuclear energy reduces CO₂ emissions.

23
00:01:23,485 --> 00:01:27,022
Nuclear energy is arguably way less
harmful to the environment

24
00:01:27,022 --> 00:01:30,951
in terms of climate change than fossil
fuels, our main source of energy.

25
00:01:31,331 --> 00:01:36,294
Since 1976, about 64 gigatons of
greenhouse gas emissions

26
00:01:36,294 --> 00:01:39,872
have not been pumped out thanks
to nuclear energy.

27
00:01:40,122 --> 00:01:46,333
And by the mid-21st century, that could
amount to an additional 80–240 gigatons.

28
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:49,823
Humanity’s energy consumption is
rising steadily.

29
00:01:50,273 --> 00:01:54,286
According to US government projections,
China alone will add the equivalent of

30
00:01:54,286 --> 00:01:58,460
a new 600-MW coal plant every 10 days
for the next 10 years.

31
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,952
China already burns 4 billion tons of
coal each year.

32
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:05,699
Coal is cheap, relatively abundant, and
easy to get to.

33
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:09,364
So it’s not likely that humanity will stop
using it soon.

34
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:13,877
Nuclear energy might be the only way of
dampening the effects of climate change

35
00:02:13,877 --> 00:02:17,600
and preventing a catastrophic man-made
global warming.

36
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,949
Compared to the other things we do,
nuclear energy is relatively clean.

37
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:25,957
So, even if it is a good idea to quit
nuclear energy long-term,

38
00:02:25,957 --> 00:02:28,651
it might be a good solution for
the next hundred years or so,

39
00:02:28,651 --> 00:02:30,463
compared to the alternatives.

40
00:02:31,053 --> 00:02:32,901
Three: new technologies.

41
00:02:33,581 --> 00:02:38,567
Maybe technology will solve the problem of
nuclear waste and dangerous power plants.

42
00:02:39,087 --> 00:02:43,688
The nuclear reactors we’ve used so far are
mostly outdated technology,

43
00:02:43,688 --> 00:02:46,701
because nuclear innovation
stopped in the 1970s.

44
00:02:47,081 --> 00:02:49,152
There are models, like the
thorium reactor,

45
00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:51,186
that could solve the problem altogether.

46
00:02:51,856 --> 00:02:55,003
Thorium is abundant, really hard to turn
into nuclear weapons,

47
00:02:55,003 --> 00:02:59,520
and up to two orders of magnitude less
wasteful than current nuclear reactors.

48
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:03,820
The waste material might also be only
dangerous for a few hundred years,

49
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,217
in contrast to a couple of thousand years.

50
00:03:06,527 --> 00:03:10,201
1 ton of thorium is estimated to provide
the same amount of energy

51
00:03:10,201 --> 00:03:14,400
as 200 tons of uranium or
3.5 million tons of coal.

52
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:18,303
So while we cannot know for sure if
alternative nuclear technology

53
00:03:18,303 --> 00:03:21,281
will keep its promises, shouldn’t we at
least do more research

54
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:25,397
before we forego an opportunity to solve
lots of humanity’s current problems?

55
00:03:25,797 --> 00:03:29,523
It may not be an easy challenge,
but that hasn’t stopped us before.

56
00:03:29,973 --> 00:03:32,479
So, should we use nuclear energy?

57
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:35,683
There are risks involved in any great
human endeavor,

58
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:39,321
and we have to make an informed decision,
rather than rely on gut feeling.

59
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,512

side of the argument, or
