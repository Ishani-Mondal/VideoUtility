1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,260
three reasons why we should stop using
nuclear energy

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,509
one. nuclear weapons proliferation

3
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:10,740
nuclear technology made a violent
entrance onto the world stage

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,179
just one year after the world's
first-ever nuclear test explosion in

5
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:15,240
1944

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,539
two large cities were destroyed by just
two single bombs

7
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,800
after that, reactor technology slowly
evolved as a means of generating

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,199
electricity but it's always been
intimately connected with nuclear

9
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:27,279
weapons technology

10
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,599
it's nearly impossible to develop
nuclear weapons without access to reactor

11
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:32,410
technology

12
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:36,670
in fact the nuclear non-proliferation
treaty serves the purpose of spreading

13
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,200
nuclear reactor technology

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,370
without spreading nuclear weapons, with
limited success

15
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,190
in forty years five countries have
developed their own weapons with the

16
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,800
help of reactor technology

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,399
the fact of the matter is that it can be
very hard to distinguish

18
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,579
a covert nuclear weapons program from
the peaceful use of nuclear energy

19
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:58,680
in the nineteen seventies the big
nuclear powers were happily selling

20
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,859
peaceful technology to smaller countries
which then developed weapons of their

21
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:03,629
own

22
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:08,960
the road to deadly nuclear weapons is
always paved with peaceful reactors

23
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:15,250
2. nuclear waste and pollution spent
nuclear fuel is not only radioactive

24
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:19,939
but also contains extremely poisonous
chemical elements like plutonium

25
00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:24,590
it loses its harmfulness only slowly over
several tens of thousands of years

26
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,900
and there is also a process called re
processing

27
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,460
which means the extraction of plutonium
from spent nuclear fuel

28
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,890
it can be used for two purposes: to build
nuclear weapons

29
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,030
or to use it as new fuel, but hardly
any of it is used as fuel

30
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,579
because we don't have the right kind of
reactors for that, a milligram

31
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:46,950
will kill you a few kilograms make an
atomic bomb and even an inconspicuous

32
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,180
country like Germany

33
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,130
literally has tons of the stuff just
lying around because re processing

34
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,350
sounded like a good idea decades ago

35
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,100
and

36
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,680
Where will all the waste go? after dumping it into
the ocean was forbidden

37
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,580
we've tried to bury it, but we can't find
a place where it will definitely stay

38
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,740
secure for tens of thousands of years

39
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,300
over 30 countries operate nearly 400
reactors

40
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,640
managing several hundred thousands of
tons of nuclear waste

41
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,960
and only one is currently serious about
opening

42
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,210
a permanent civilian waste storage: tiny
Finland

43
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,370
3. accidents and disasters

44
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:26,330
over sixty years of nuclear power usage
there have been seven major accidents in

45
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,030
reactors

46
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,660
or facilities dealing with nuclear waste
three of those were mostly contained

47
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,350
but four of them released significant amounts
of radioactivity into the

48
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,200
environment

49
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,760
in 1957, 1987 and 2011

50
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,020
large areas of land in Russia Ukraine
and Japan

51
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,760
Were rendered unfit for human habitation for
decades to come

52
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,570
the number of deaths is highly disputed
But probably lies in the thousands

53
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:55,580
these disasters happened with nuclear
reactors of very different types

54
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,840
in very different countries and several
decades apart

55
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,090
looking at the numbers we may as well
ask ourselves: are 10 percent of the

56
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,370
world's energy supply

57
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,720
worth a devastating disaster every 30
years?

58
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,519
would thirty percent be worth another
Fukushima or chernobyl somewhere on

59
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:11,920
earth

60
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,690
every 10 years? what area would have to
be contaminated

61
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,190
so we say no more? where is the line?

62
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:22,420
so should we use nuclear energy?

63
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:27,010
the risks may outweigh the benefits and
maybe we should stop looking into this

64
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:27,670
direction

65
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:31,540
and drop this technology for good if you
want to hear the other side of the

66
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,130
argument
