this wasn't extreme enough let's take a

this wasn't extreme enough let's take a
 

167
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,670
this wasn't extreme enough let's take a
look at a few other properties neutron

168
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:45,680
look at a few other properties neutron
 

169
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,860
look at a few other properties neutron
stars spin very very far

170
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:47,870
stars spin very very far
 

171
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,380
stars spin very very far
young ones several times per second and

172
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:50,390
young ones several times per second and
 

173
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,720
young ones several times per second and
if there's a poor star nearby to feed

174
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:52,730
if there's a poor star nearby to feed
 

175
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,670
if there's a poor star nearby to feed
the neutron star it can rotate up to

176
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:54,680
the neutron star it can rotate up to
 

177
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,380
the neutron star it can rotate up to
several hundred times per second

178
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:56,390
several hundred times per second
 

179
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:59,620
several hundred times per second
like the object PSR Jay one seven four

180
00:03:59,620 --> 00:03:59,630
like the object PSR Jay one seven four
 

181
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:02,410
like the object PSR Jay one seven four
eight two four four six ad it spins

182
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:02,420
eight two four four six ad it spins
 

183
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,470
eight two four four six ad it spins
that's approximately 252 million

184
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:05,480
that's approximately 252 million
 

185
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,770
that's approximately 252 million
kilometers per hour this is so fast that

186
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:08,780
kilometers per hour this is so fast that
 

187
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,280
kilometers per hour this is so fast that
the star has a rather strange shape we

188
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:12,290
the star has a rather strange shape we
 

189
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,410
the star has a rather strange shape we
call these objects pulsars because they

190
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:14,420
call these objects pulsars because they
 

191
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,630
call these objects pulsars because they
emit a strong radio signal and the

192
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:16,640
emit a strong radio signal and the
 

193
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,460
emit a strong radio signal and the
magnetic field of a neutron star is

194
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:18,470
magnetic field of a neutron star is
 

195
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,440
magnetic field of a neutron star is
roughly eight trillion times stronger

196
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:20,450
roughly eight trillion times stronger
 

197
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,720
roughly eight trillion times stronger
than the magnetic field of Earth so

198
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:22,730
than the magnetic field of Earth so
 

199
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,150
than the magnetic field of Earth so
strong that atoms get bent when they

200
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:25,160
strong that atoms get bent when they
 

201
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,000
strong that atoms get bent when they
enter its influence okay I think we got

202
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,010
enter its influence okay I think we got
 

203
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,520

the point across neutron stars are some

204
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:30,530
the point across neutron stars are some
 

205
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,920
the point across neutron stars are some
of the most extreme but also some of the

206
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:32,930
of the most extreme but also some of the
 

207
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,950
of the most extreme but also some of the
coolest objects in the universe

208
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:34,960
coolest objects in the universe
 

209
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,360
coolest objects in the universe
hopefully will one day send spaceships

210
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:37,370
hopefully will one day send spaceships
 

211
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,400
hopefully will one day send spaceships
to learn more about them and take some

212
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:39,410
to learn more about them and take some
 

213
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:42,190
to learn more about them and take some
neat pictures but we shouldn't get too

214
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:42,200
neat pictures but we shouldn't get too
 

215
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:48,340
neat pictures but we shouldn't get too
close
