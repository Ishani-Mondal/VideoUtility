00:00:10,709 --> 00:00:10,719
where we answer curious questions for
 

7
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,110
where we answer curious questions for
curious minds. What are

8
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:14,120
curious minds. What are
 

9
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,630
curious minds. What are
primates? You may have seen monkeys at

10
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:16,640
primates? You may have seen monkeys at
 

11
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,349
primates? You may have seen monkeys at
the zoo or watched documentaries about

12
00:00:19,349 --> 00:00:19,359
the zoo or watched documentaries about
 

13
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,029
the zoo or watched documentaries about
gorillas in the wild, but what exactly

14
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:23,039
gorillas in the wild, but what exactly
 

15
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,230
gorillas in the wild, but what exactly
is a primate? And did you know that

16
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:26,240
is a primate? And did you know that
 

17
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,429
is a primate? And did you know that
humans are primates, too? Let's explore

18
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:30,439
humans are primates, too? Let's explore
 

19
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:32,790
humans are primates, too? Let's explore
together. Primates are a group of

20
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:32,800
together. Primates are a group of
 

21
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,590
together. Primates are a group of
mammals that include some very familiar

22
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:35,600
mammals that include some very familiar
 

23
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,350
mammals that include some very familiar
animals like monkeys, apes, and yes,

24
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:40,360
animals like monkeys, apes, and yes,
 

25
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,670
animals like monkeys, apes, and yes,
people. This group also includes animals

26
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:43,680
people. This group also includes animals
 

27
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,029
people. This group also includes animals
like lemurs, lorises, and tarscers,

28
00:00:47,029 --> 00:00:47,039
like lemurs, lorises, and tarscers,
 

29
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,790
like lemurs, lorises, and tarscers,
which you might not hear about as often.

30
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:50,800
which you might not hear about as often.
 

31
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,869
which you might not hear about as often.
So, what makes a primate a

32
00:00:53,869 --> 00:00:53,879
So, what makes a primate a
 

33
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:57,670
So, what makes a primate a
primate? Let's break it down.

34
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:57,680
primate? Let's break it down.
 

35
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,310
primate? Let's break it down.
Primates usually have large brains

36
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:00,320
Primates usually have large brains
 

37
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,029
Primates usually have large brains
compared to the size of their bodies.

38
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:03,039
compared to the size of their bodies.
 

39
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,230
compared to the size of their bodies.
This helps them think, solve problems,

40
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:06,240
This helps them think, solve problems,
 

41
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,310
This helps them think, solve problems,
and sometimes even use

42
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:09,320
and sometimes even use
 

43
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,469
and sometimes even use
tools. They also have forward-facing

44
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:12,479
tools. They also have forward-facing
 

45
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,469
tools. They also have forward-facing
eyes, which helps them see in 3D. This

46
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:16,479
eyes, which helps them see in 3D. This
 

47
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,710
eyes, which helps them see in 3D. This
is great for climbing and jumping

48
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:18,720
is great for climbing and jumping
 

49
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,590
is great for climbing and jumping
through trees because they can judge

50
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:21,600
through trees because they can judge
 

51
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,109
through trees because they can judge
distances really well. Primates also

52
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:25,119
distances really well. Primates also
 

53
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,670
distances really well. Primates also
have grasping hands and feet with

54
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:27,680
have grasping hands and feet with
 

55
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,789
have grasping hands and feet with
opposable thumbs. That means their

56
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:30,799
opposable thumbs. That means their
 

57
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,350
opposable thumbs. That means their
thumbs can touch their other fingers

58
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:33,360
thumbs can touch their other fingers
 

59
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,429
thumbs can touch their other fingers
just like

60
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:34,439
just like
 

61
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:37,670
just like
ours. This helps them grab branches,

62
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:37,680
ours. This helps them grab branches,
 

63
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,590
ours. This helps them grab branches,
peel fruit, and even groom each other.

64
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:41,600
peel fruit, and even groom each other.
 

65
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,950
peel fruit, and even groom each other.
Primates are very social animals. Many

66
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:44,960
Primates are very social animals. Many
 

67
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,230
Primates are very social animals. Many
live in groups called troops, bands, or

68
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:48,240
live in groups called troops, bands, or
 

69
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,830
live in groups called troops, bands, or
families.

70
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:49,840
families.
 

71
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,710
families.
They use sounds, body language, and

72
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:52,720
They use sounds, body language, and
 

73
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,870
They use sounds, body language, and
facial expressions to communicate with

74
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:54,880
facial expressions to communicate with
 

75
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,270
facial expressions to communicate with
each other. Some, like chimpanzees, even

76
00:01:59,270 --> 00:01:59,280
each other. Some, like chimpanzees, even
 

77
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,510
each other. Some, like chimpanzees, even
use tools to get food or solve

78
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:02,520
use tools to get food or solve
 

79
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,069
use tools to get food or solve
problems. For example, chimps use sticks

80
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:06,079
problems. For example, chimps use sticks
 

81
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,949
problems. For example, chimps use sticks
to catch termites. That's something not

82
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:08,959
to catch termites. That's something not
 

83
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,470
to catch termites. That's something not
many animals can do. Primates live in

84
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:12,480
many animals can do. Primates live in
 

85
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,869
many animals can do. Primates live in
many parts of the world, mostly in

86
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:14,879
many parts of the world, mostly in
 

87
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,190
many parts of the world, mostly in
tropical areas. You can find them in

88
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:18,200
tropical areas. You can find them in
 

89
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,229
tropical areas. You can find them in
Africa, Asia, Central and South America,

90
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:22,239
Africa, Asia, Central and South America,
 

91
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,750
Africa, Asia, Central and South America,
and on the islands like

92
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:24,760
and on the islands like
 

93
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,070
and on the islands like
Madagascar. Most primates live in trees,

94
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:28,080
Madagascar. Most primates live in trees,
 

95
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,550
Madagascar. Most primates live in trees,
especially smaller ones like tamarind

96
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:30,560
especially smaller ones like tamarind
 

97
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,150
especially smaller ones like tamarind
and marmicetses. Others like baboons

98
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,160
and marmicetses. Others like baboons
 

99
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,350
and marmicetses. Others like baboons
spend more time on the ground. Primates

100
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:37,360
spend more time on the ground. Primates
 

101
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,470
spend more time on the ground. Primates
have been around for a long time, about

102
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,480
have been around for a long time, about
 

103
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,630
have been around for a long time, about
60 million years.

104
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:42,640
60 million years.
 

105
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,270
60 million years.
Scientists think the first primates were

106
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:45,280
Scientists think the first primates were
 

107
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,150
Scientists think the first primates were
small tree dwelling animals that came

108
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,160
small tree dwelling animals that came
 

109
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,030
small tree dwelling animals that came
out mostly at

110
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:50,040
out mostly at
 

111
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,949
out mostly at
night. Over time, different types of

112
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:52,959
night. Over time, different types of
 

113
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,150
night. Over time, different types of
primates evolved. Some stayed small and

114
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,160
primates evolved. Some stayed small and
 

115
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,830
primates evolved. Some stayed small and
lived in trees. Others, like apes, grew

116
00:02:59,830 --> 00:02:59,840
lived in trees. Others, like apes, grew
 

117
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,190
lived in trees. Others, like apes, grew
larger and developed stronger brains.

118
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:03,200
larger and developed stronger brains.
 

119
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,550
larger and developed stronger brains.
Humans are part of the great ape group.

120
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:06,560
Humans are part of the great ape group.
 

121
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,110
Humans are part of the great ape group.
That includes

122
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:08,120
That includes
 

123
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,190
That includes
gorillas,

124
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:10,200
gorillas,
 

125
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,270
gorillas,
chimpanzees, bonabos, and

126
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:14,280
chimpanzees, bonabos, and
 

127
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,430
chimpanzees, bonabos, and
orangutans. So, what makes humans

128
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:17,440
orangutans. So, what makes humans
 

129
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,589
orangutans. So, what makes humans
special if we're primates,

130
00:03:20,589 --> 00:03:20,599
special if we're primates,
 

131
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:24,229
special if we're primates,
too? Well, humans are the only primates

132
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:24,239
too? Well, humans are the only primates
 

133
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,430
too? Well, humans are the only primates
that walk fully upright on two legs all

134
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,440
that walk fully upright on two legs all
 

135
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,030
that walk fully upright on two legs all
of the time.

136
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,040
of the time.
 

137
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,789
of the time.
We also have the most complex language

138
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:32,799
We also have the most complex language
 

139
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,630
We also have the most complex language
and we create things like art, machines,

140
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:36,640
and we create things like art, machines,
 

141
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,550
and we create things like art, machines,
and

142
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:37,560
and
 

143
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,470
and
cities. But when it comes to our bodies

144
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:40,480
cities. But when it comes to our bodies
 

145
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,350
cities. But when it comes to our bodies
and our DNA, we're not all that

146
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:43,360
and our DNA, we're not all that
 

147
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,149
and our DNA, we're not all that
different from other

148
00:03:45,149 --> 00:03:45,159
different from other
 

149
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:48,630
different from other
primates. In fact, chimpanzees share

150
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:48,640
primates. In fact, chimpanzees share
 

151
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,589
primates. In fact, chimpanzees share
over 98% of their DNA with humans. That

152
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:53,599
over 98% of their DNA with humans. That
 

153
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,470
over 98% of their DNA with humans. That
means we're closer to chimps than chimps

154
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:56,480
means we're closer to chimps than chimps
 

155
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,789
means we're closer to chimps than chimps
are to monkeys.

156
00:03:58,789 --> 00:03:58,799
are to monkeys.
 

157
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,190
are to monkeys.
Scientists study primates to learn more

158
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,200
Scientists study primates to learn more
 

159
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,470
Scientists study primates to learn more
about how humans evolved, how we behave,

160
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:04,480
about how humans evolved, how we behave,
 

161
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,670
about how humans evolved, how we behave,
and even how we care for others. Some

162
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:07,680
and even how we care for others. Some
 

163
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,990
and even how we care for others. Some

164
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,000
primates are known for showing kindness
 

165
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,910
primates are known for showing kindness
and

166
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:10,920
and
 

167
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,070
and
teamwork. For example, bonobos are

168
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:14,080
teamwork. For example, bonobos are
 

169
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,390
teamwork. For example, bonobos are
peaceful animals that share food and

170
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:16,400
peaceful animals that share food and
 

171
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,590
peaceful animals that share food and
avoid fighting when they can. Watching

172
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:19,600
avoid fighting when they can. Watching
 

173
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,629
avoid fighting when they can. Watching
other primates helps us learn not only

174
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:22,639
other primates helps us learn not only
 

175
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,550
other primates helps us learn not only
about biology but also about emotions,

176
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:26,560
about biology but also about emotions,
 

177
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,670
about biology but also about emotions,
friendships, and family. Now, let's take
