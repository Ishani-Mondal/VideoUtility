35
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,990

is formed through refraction,

36
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:51,000
is formed through refraction,
 

37
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,670
is formed through refraction,
reflection, and dispersion of light

38
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:53,680
reflection, and dispersion of light
 

39
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,189
reflection, and dispersion of light
inside those droplets. In simple terms,

00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:57,199
inside those droplets. In simple terms,
 

41
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,790
inside those droplets. In simple terms,
light enters a raindrop, bends, bounces

light enters a raindrop, bends, bounces
 

43
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,149
light enters a raindrop, bends, bounces
inside, and comes back out but split

00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:08,870
into different
colors. To understand rainbows, we need

48
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:08,880
colors. To understand rainbows, we need
 

49
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,230
colors. To understand rainbows, we need
to understand light. Sunlight may appear

50
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:12,240
to understand light. Sunlight may appear
 

51
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,390
to understand light. Sunlight may appear
white, but it's actually a combination

52
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:14,400
white, but it's actually a combination
 

53
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,230
white, but it's actually a combination
of many colors, the visible spectrum.

54
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,240
of many colors, the visible spectrum.
 

55
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,510
of many colors, the visible spectrum.
This spectrum includes red, orange,

56
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:21,520
This spectrum includes red, orange,
 

57
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,789
This spectrum includes red, orange,
yellow, green, blue, indigo, and

58
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:25,799
yellow, green, blue, indigo, and
 

59
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,469
yellow, green, blue, indigo, and
violet. Each color has a different

60
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:28,479
violet. Each color has a different
 

61
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,429
violet. Each color has a different
wavelength with red having the longest

62
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:31,439
wavelength with red having the longest
 

63
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,630
wavelength with red having the longest
and violet the shortest. When white

64
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:34,640
and violet the shortest. When white
 

65
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,350
and violet the shortest. When white
light passes through a medium like water

66
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:37,360
light passes through a medium like water
 

67
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,630
light passes through a medium like water
or glass, it bends or

68
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:41,640
or glass, it bends or
 

69
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,030
or glass, it bends or
refracts. Because each color bends by a

70
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:45,040
refracts. Because each color bends by a
 

71
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,510
refracts. Because each color bends by a
slightly different amount, the light

72
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:47,520
slightly different amount, the light
 

73
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,109
slightly different amount, the light
separates into its component colors.

74
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:51,119
separates into its component colors.
 

75
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,550
separates into its component colors.
This process is called

76
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:53,560
This process is called
 

77
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,789
This process is called
dispersion. Here's how a rainbow forms

78
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:56,799
dispersion. Here's how a rainbow forms

Refraction. Sunlight enters a water
 

85
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,950
Refraction. Sunlight enters a water
droplet in the atmosphere. It slows down

00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:06,960
droplet in the atmosphere. It slows down
 

87
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,150

and bends due to the change in medium

88
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,160
and bends due to the change in medium
 

89
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,630
and bends due to the change in medium
from air to water.

00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:29,520
second time as it moves from water back
 

101
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,030
second time as it moves from water back
into air. Each droplet sends out light

102
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,040
into air. Each droplet sends out light
 

103
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,430

contributes only one color to the
 

115
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,869
contributes only one color to the
rainbow you see. The full ark is the

00:02:54,869 --> 00:02:54,879
rainbow you see. The full ark is the
 

117
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,670

Rainbows appear as arcs because of
 

125
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,229
Rainbows appear as arcs because of
geometry. Light exits water droplets at

126
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:10,239
geometry. Light exits water droplets at
 

127
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,509
geometry. Light exits water droplets at
specific angles and our eyes perceive

00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:13,519
specific angles and our eyes perceive
 

129
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,990

the rainbow only where those angles
 

131
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,390
the rainbow only where those angles
align. The result is a cone-shaped
