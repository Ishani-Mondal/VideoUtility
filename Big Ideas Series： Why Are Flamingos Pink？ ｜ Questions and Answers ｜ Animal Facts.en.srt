flamingos don't eat carrots. So, how

flamingos don't eat carrots. So, how

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,230
flamingos don't eat carrots. So, how
does this work? In the wild, flamingos

shrimp and blue green algae. These
organisms are rich in

00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:51,880
organisms are rich in
 

73
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,030
organisms are rich in
keratenoids, particularly a type called

keratenoids, particularly a type called
 

75
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,270
keratenoids, particularly a type called
betaarotene and

betaarotene and

00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,030
betaarotene and

canththenazine. When flamingos consume

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,270
canththenazine. When flamingos consume
this food, their bodies metabolize the

this food, their bodies metabolize the
 

81
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,030
this food, their bodies metabolize the
keratenoids and deposit the pigments

keratenoids and deposit the pigments
 

83
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,309
keratenoids and deposit the pigments
into their skin and

into their skin and

00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:12,550
into their skin and
feathers. Over time, their plumage turns

86
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:12,560
feathers. Over time, their plumage turns
 

87
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,750
feathers. Over time, their plumage turns
a vibrant pink or even reddish hue. Now,

a vibrant pink or even reddish hue. Now,

a vibrant pink or even reddish hue. Now,
the strength of that pink color depends

the strength of that pink color depends
 

91
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,270
the strength of that pink color depends
entirely on how much keratenoid rich

entirely on how much keratenoid rich

they often require a special diet that

00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,200
they often require a special diet that
 

101
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,150
they often require a special diet that
mimics their natural intake. Without

mimics their natural intake. Without
 

103
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,309
mimics their natural intake. Without
that diet, their feathers would fade to

104
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:42,319
that diet, their feathers would fade to
 

105
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,750
that diet, their feathers would fade to
a pale gray or white.

Zoologologists often supplement flamingo

Zoologologists often supplement flamingo

Zoologologists often supplement flamingo

pink plumage isn't just for show. It
 

121
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,309
pink plumage isn't just for show. It
plays a crucial role in social behavior

flamingo's color can signal its

00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:20,959
flamingo's color can signal its
 

133
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,070
flamingo's color can signal its
nutritional status, immune strength, and

134
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,080
nutritional status, immune strength, and
 

135
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,949
nutritional status, immune strength, and
reproductive fitness. Researchers have

136
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:26,959
reproductive fitness. Researchers have
 

137
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,030
reproductive fitness. Researchers have
found that flamingos with duller

138
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,040
found that flamingos with duller
 

139
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,589
found that flamingos with duller
feathers are often passed over during

140
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:31,599
feathers are often passed over during
 

141
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,710
feathers are often passed over during
courtship displays. So, a rich pink

142
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:34,720
courtship displays. So, a rich pink
 

143
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,030
courtship displays. So, a rich pink
color can directly influence a

144
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,040
color can directly influence a
 

145
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,309
color can directly influence a
flamingo's ability to reproduce.

146
00:03:41,309 --> 00:03:41,319
flamingo's ability to reproduce.
 

147
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:44,309
flamingo's ability to reproduce.
Interestingly, some flamingos even ramp

148
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:44,319
Interestingly, some flamingos even ramp
 

149
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,390
Interestingly, some flamingos even ramp
up pining before mating season,

150
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:48,400
up pining before mating season,
 

151
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,630
up pining before mating season,
spreading oil from a gland near their

spreading oil from a gland near their
tails over their

tails over their
 

155
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,270
tails over their
feathers. This oil can enhance their

156
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:55,280
feathers. This oil can enhance their
 

157
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,990
feathers. This oil can enhance their
color temporarily, much like putting on

color temporarily, much like putting on
 

159
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,390
color temporarily, much like putting on
makeup. In other words, pink isn't just

160
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,400
makeup. In other words, pink isn't just
 

161
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,830

pretty, it's powerful. There are six

00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:05,840
pretty, it's powerful. There are six
 

163
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,630

standing proudly in the wild, remember
 

263
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,430
standing proudly in the wild, remember
that pink hue is a signal, a story, and

that pink hue is a signal, a story, and

that pink hue is a signal, a story, and
