Bees are nature's most effective

18
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:29,080
Bees are nature's most effective
 

19
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,910
Bees are nature's most effective
pollinators. When bees visit a flower to

20
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:31,920
pollinators. When bees visit a flower to
 

21
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,110
pollinators. When bees visit a flower to
gather nectar, grains of pollen stick to

22
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:35,120
gather nectar, grains of pollen stick to
 

23
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,030
gather nectar, grains of pollen stick to
their bodies. As they move to the next

flower, some of that pollen is
