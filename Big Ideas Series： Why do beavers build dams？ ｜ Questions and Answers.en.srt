00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:10,800
where we answer curious questions for
 

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,669
where we answer curious questions for
curious minds. Why do beavers build

8
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:14,679
curious minds. Why do beavers build
 

9
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:17,910
curious minds. Why do beavers build
dams? Beavers are one of nature's most

10
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:17,920
dams? Beavers are one of nature's most
 

11
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,390
dams? Beavers are one of nature's most
skilled builders. They're known for

12
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:20,400
skilled builders. They're known for
 

13
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,029
skilled builders. They're known for
creating large structures out of sticks,

14
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:23,039
creating large structures out of sticks,
 

15
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,509
creating large structures out of sticks,
mud, and rocks. These are called dams.

16
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:27,519
mud, and rocks. These are called dams.
 

17
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,910
mud, and rocks. These are called dams.
But have you ever wondered why beavers

18
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:29,920
But have you ever wondered why beavers
 

19
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,950
But have you ever wondered why beavers
build dams in the first place? In this

20
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:32,960
build dams in the first place? In this
 

21
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,709
build dams in the first place? In this
video, we're going to explore the

22
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:34,719
video, we're going to explore the
 

23
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,750
video, we're going to explore the
reasons behind this amazing behavior.

24
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:37,760
reasons behind this amazing behavior.
 

25
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,310
reasons behind this amazing behavior.
We'll look at how beavers build dams,

26
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:40,320
We'll look at how beavers build dams,
 

27
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,310
We'll look at how beavers build dams,
what they're made of, and how these

28
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:42,320
what they're made of, and how these
 

29
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,830
what they're made of, and how these
structures help beavers survive in the

30
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:44,840
structures help beavers survive in the
 

31
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,990
structures help beavers survive in the
wild. We'll also learn how beaver dams

32
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:48,000
wild. We'll also learn how beaver dams
 

33
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,670
wild. We'll also learn how beaver dams
can affect the environment around

34
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:50,680
can affect the environment around
 

35
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,549
can affect the environment around
them. Let's get started. Beavers build

36
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:54,559
them. Let's get started. Beavers build
 

37
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,910
them. Let's get started. Beavers build
dams for one main reason, to create a

38
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:57,920
dams for one main reason, to create a
 

39
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,430
dams for one main reason, to create a
safe and stable home. Beavers live in

40
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:01,440
safe and stable home. Beavers live in
 

41
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,750
safe and stable home. Beavers live in
lodges, which are dome-shaped houses

42
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:03,760
lodges, which are dome-shaped houses
 

43
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,429
lodges, which are dome-shaped houses
made of sticks and mud. These lodges are

44
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:07,439
made of sticks and mud. These lodges are
 

45
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,310
made of sticks and mud. These lodges are
built in water, usually in ponds or

46
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:10,320
built in water, usually in ponds or
 

47
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,670
built in water, usually in ponds or
slowmoving streams. But many streams

48
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:13,680
slowmoving streams. But many streams
 

49
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,230
slowmoving streams. But many streams
move too quickly or don't have enough

50
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:16,240
move too quickly or don't have enough
 

51
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,710
move too quickly or don't have enough
deep water for beavers to safely build

52
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:18,720
deep water for beavers to safely build
 

53
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,230
deep water for beavers to safely build
their lodges. That's where dams come in.

54
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:22,240
their lodges. That's where dams come in.
 

55
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,109
their lodges. That's where dams come in.
When a beaver builds a dam, it slows

56
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:25,119
When a beaver builds a dam, it slows
 

57
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,469
When a beaver builds a dam, it slows
down the flow of water in a stream. This

58
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:28,479
down the flow of water in a stream. This
 

59
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,749
down the flow of water in a stream. This
creates a pond. The pond becomes the

60
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:31,759
creates a pond. The pond becomes the
 

61
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,870
creates a pond. The pond becomes the
perfect place to build a lodge. The

62
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:34,880
perfect place to build a lodge. The
 

63
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,429
perfect place to build a lodge. The
water around the lodge makes it hard for

64
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:37,439
water around the lodge makes it hard for
 

65
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,590
water around the lodge makes it hard for
predators like coyotes, wolves, or bears

66
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:41,600
predators like coyotes, wolves, or bears
 

67
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,630
predators like coyotes, wolves, or bears
to reach the beaver's home. It also

68
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:44,640
to reach the beaver's home. It also
 

69
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,590
to reach the beaver's home. It also
helps the beaver stay warm and hidden

70
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:47,600
helps the beaver stay warm and hidden
 

71
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,109
helps the beaver stay warm and hidden
during the winter. So, how do beavers

72
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:51,119
during the winter. So, how do beavers
 

73
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,550
during the winter. So, how do beavers
build these dams? They start by finding

74
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:54,560
build these dams? They start by finding
 

75
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,990
build these dams? They start by finding
a good spot in a stream. Then, they

76
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,000
a good spot in a stream. Then, they
 

77
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,190
a good spot in a stream. Then, they
collect branches, twigs, rocks, and mud.

78
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:03,200
collect branches, twigs, rocks, and mud.
 

79
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,230
collect branches, twigs, rocks, and mud.
Using their strong teeth, they cut down

80
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:06,240
Using their strong teeth, they cut down
 

81
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,029
Using their strong teeth, they cut down
small trees and drag them to the dam

82
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:09,039
small trees and drag them to the dam
 

83
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,630
small trees and drag them to the dam
site. They carefully pile the materials

84
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:12,640
site. They carefully pile the materials
 

85
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,350
site. They carefully pile the materials
across the stream.

86
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:15,360
across the stream.
 

87
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,790
across the stream.
As the water slows down, the beaver adds

88
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:18,800
As the water slows down, the beaver adds
 

89
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,390
As the water slows down, the beaver adds
more mud and sticks to seal the gaps.

90
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:22,400
more mud and sticks to seal the gaps.
 

91
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,110
more mud and sticks to seal the gaps.
This process can take days or even

92
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,120
This process can take days or even
 

93
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,670
This process can take days or even
weeks, depending on how big the dam

94
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:27,680
weeks, depending on how big the dam
 

95
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,750
weeks, depending on how big the dam
needs to be. But beavers are patient.

96
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:31,760
needs to be. But beavers are patient.
 

97
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,830
needs to be. But beavers are patient.
They keep working until they have

98
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:33,840
They keep working until they have
 

99
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,150
They keep working until they have
created a deep pond where they can

100
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,160
created a deep pond where they can
 

101
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,350
created a deep pond where they can
safely build a lodge. Some dams are

102
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:39,360
safely build a lodge. Some dams are
 

103
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,190
safely build a lodge. Some dams are
small, just a few feet wide. Others can

104
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,200
small, just a few feet wide. Others can
 

105
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,630
small, just a few feet wide. Others can
be massive, stretching over 1,000 ft

106
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:46,640
be massive, stretching over 1,000 ft
 

107
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,990
be massive, stretching over 1,000 ft
long. In fact, the largest known beaver

108
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,000
long. In fact, the largest known beaver
 

109
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,710
long. In fact, the largest known beaver
dam is in Alberta, Canada. It's over

110
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:53,720
dam is in Alberta, Canada. It's over
 

111
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,589
dam is in Alberta, Canada. It's over
2,700 ft long and can be even seen from

112
00:02:58,589 --> 00:02:58,599
2,700 ft long and can be even seen from
 

113
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:01,910
2,700 ft long and can be even seen from
space. Once the dam is built and the

114
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:01,920
space. Once the dam is built and the
 

115
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,790
space. Once the dam is built and the
pond is deep enough, the beaver builds

116
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:04,800
pond is deep enough, the beaver builds
 

117
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,990
pond is deep enough, the beaver builds
its lodge. The lodge is usually located

118
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,000
its lodge. The lodge is usually located
 

119
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,790
its lodge. The lodge is usually located
in the middle of the pond or along the

120
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:10,800
in the middle of the pond or along the
 

121
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,390
in the middle of the pond or along the
edge. It has underwater entrances that

122
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:14,400
edge. It has underwater entrances that
 

123
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,509
edge. It has underwater entrances that
help keep out predators. Inside the

124
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:17,519
help keep out predators. Inside the
 

125
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,110
help keep out predators. Inside the
lodge, there is a dry living space above

126
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:21,120
lodge, there is a dry living space above
 

127
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,390
lodge, there is a dry living space above
the water line. It's lined with softwood

128
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:24,400
the water line. It's lined with softwood
 

129
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,509
the water line. It's lined with softwood
shavings and

130
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:26,519
shavings and
 

131
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,670
shavings and
grass. Beavers live in family groups

132
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:29,680
grass. Beavers live in family groups
 

133
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,470
grass. Beavers live in family groups
called colonies. So, a lodge might have

134
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:32,480
called colonies. So, a lodge might have
 

135
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,990
called colonies. So, a lodge might have
a pair of adult beavers and their young.

136
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,000
a pair of adult beavers and their young.
 

137
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,110
a pair of adult beavers and their young.
The dam and the lodge work together to

138
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,120
The dam and the lodge work together to
 

139
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,070
The dam and the lodge work together to
give the Beaver family a safe and cozy

140
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,080
give the Beaver family a safe and cozy
 

141
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,070
give the Beaver family a safe and cozy
place to live year round. But dams don't

142
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,080
place to live year round. But dams don't
 

143
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,990
place to live year round. But dams don't
just help beavers. They also have a big

144
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,000
just help beavers. They also have a big
 

145
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,550
just help beavers. They also have a big
impact on the

146
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:51,560
impact on the
 

147
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,309
impact on the
environment. When a beaver builds a dam

148
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:54,319
environment. When a beaver builds a dam
 

149
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,630
environment. When a beaver builds a dam
and creates a pond, it changes the

150
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:57,640
and creates a pond, it changes the
 

151
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,550
and creates a pond, it changes the
landscape. The new pond becomes a wet

152
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:00,560
landscape. The new pond becomes a wet
 

153
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,910
landscape. The new pond becomes a wet
land.

154
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:01,920
land.
 

155
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,390
land.
Wetlands are home to many types of

156
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:04,400
Wetlands are home to many types of
 

157
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,190
Wetlands are home to many types of
plants and animals. Birds, frogs, fish,

158
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:09,200

159
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,589
plants and animals. Birds, frogs, fish,
insects, and even deer might use the

160
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:11,599
insects, and even deer might use the
 

161
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,589
insects, and even deer might use the
wetland for food, shelter, and water.

162
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:15,599
wetland for food, shelter, and water.
 

163
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,150
wetland for food, shelter, and water.
Beaver ponds also help store water

164
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:18,160
Beaver ponds also help store water
 

165
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,189
Beaver ponds also help store water
during dry seasons. They slow down

166
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:21,199
during dry seasons. They slow down
 

167
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,070
during dry seasons. They slow down
flooding during heavy rains. They can

168
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,080
flooding during heavy rains. They can
 

169
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,950
flooding during heavy rains. They can
even help filter the water, trapping

170
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:26,960
even help filter the water, trapping
 

171
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,830
even help filter the water, trapping
dirt and pollution so it doesn't flow

172
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:29,840
dirt and pollution so it doesn't flow
 

173
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,350
dirt and pollution so it doesn't flow
downstream.

knowing it, beavers help make healthy

186
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:45,840
knowing it, beavers help make healthy
 

187
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,670
knowing it, beavers help make healthy
habitats for all kinds of wildlife.

188
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:49,680
habitats for all kinds of wildlife.
 

189
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,749
habitats for all kinds of wildlife.
Beaver dams also help the animals

190
00:04:52,749 --> 00:04:52,759
Beaver dams also help the animals
 

191
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,550
Beaver dams also help the animals
themselves survive tough

192
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:55,560
themselves survive tough
 

193
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,510
themselves survive tough
seasons. In the winter, ponds created by

194
00:04:59,510 --> 00:04:59,520
seasons. In the winter, ponds created by
 

195
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,390
seasons. In the winter, ponds created by
dams stay deep enough that they don't

196
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:02,400
dams stay deep enough that they don't
 

197
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,590
dams stay deep enough that they don't
freeze all the way. This means the

198
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600
freeze all the way. This means the
 

199
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,510
freeze all the way. This means the
underwater entrance to the lodge stays

200
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:08,520
underwater entrance to the lodge stays
 

201
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,990
underwater entrance to the lodge stays
open. Before winter arrives, beavers

202
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,000
open. Before winter arrives, beavers
 

203
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,870
open. Before winter arrives, beavers
collect food and store it in the pond

204
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:14,880
collect food and store it in the pond
 

205
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,749
collect food and store it in the pond
near their lodge. They mainly eat the

206
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:17,759
near their lodge. They mainly eat the
 

207
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,710
near their lodge. They mainly eat the
soft inner bark of trees along with

208
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:20,720
soft inner bark of trees along with
 

209
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,870
soft inner bark of trees along with
aquatic plants. When the pond is frozen,

210
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:24,880
aquatic plants. When the pond is frozen,
 

211
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,909
aquatic plants. When the pond is frozen,
beavers can swim along their lodge to

212
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:27,919
beavers can swim along their lodge to
 

213
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,790
beavers can swim along their lodge to
their food pile without ever having to

214
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:30,800
their food pile without ever having to
 

215
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,590
their food pile without ever having to
leave the safety of the water. Without

216
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:33,600
leave the safety of the water. Without
 

217
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,150
leave the safety of the water. Without
the dam, the pond wouldn't be deep

218
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:36,160
the dam, the pond wouldn't be deep
 

219
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,029
the dam, the pond wouldn't be deep
enough. The entrance might freeze and

220
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:39,039
enough. The entrance might freeze and
 

221
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,110
enough. The entrance might freeze and
the beavers could get trapped or

222
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:42,120
the beavers could get trapped or
 

223
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,110
the beavers could get trapped or
starve. So, building a dam is not just

224
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:45,120
starve. So, building a dam is not just
 

225
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,790
starve. So, building a dam is not just
helpful, it's a matter of survival. Dams

226
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:48,800
helpful, it's a matter of survival. Dams
 

227
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,189
helpful, it's a matter of survival. Dams
aren't permanent. They need regular

228
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:52,199
aren't permanent. They need regular
 

229
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:55,670
aren't permanent. They need regular
repairs. Storms, floods, or curious

230
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:55,680
repairs. Storms, floods, or curious
 

231
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,189
repairs. Storms, floods, or curious
animals can damage the structure. When

232
00:05:59,189 --> 00:05:59,199
animals can damage the structure. When
 

233
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,909
animals can damage the structure. When
that happens, beavers quickly get to

234
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:01,919
that happens, beavers quickly get to
 

235
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,189
that happens, beavers quickly get to
work. They check their dam almost every

236
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:05,199
work. They check their dam almost every
 

237
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,870
work. They check their dam almost every
day and make repairs as needed. Their

238
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:08,880
day and make repairs as needed. Their

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,749
day and make repairs as needed. Their
strong teeth and hardworking attitude

240
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:11,759
strong teeth and hardworking attitude
 

241
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,029
strong teeth and hardworking attitude
make them excellent engineers. Beaver

242
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:15,039
make them excellent engineers. Beaver
 

243
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,230
make them excellent engineers. Beaver
teeth never stop growing. That's why

244
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:18,240
teeth never stop growing. That's why
 

245
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,710
teeth never stop growing. That's why
they can keep gnawing on trees and

246
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:20,720
they can keep gnawing on trees and
 

247
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,189
they can keep gnawing on trees and
branches without wearing their teeth

248
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:23,199
branches without wearing their teeth
 

249
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,390
branches without wearing their teeth
down. The front teeth are orange because

250
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:26,400
down. The front teeth are orange because
 

251
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,270
down. The front teeth are orange because
of the iron in the enamel, which makes

252
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,280
of the iron in the enamel, which makes
 

253
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,029
of the iron in the enamel, which makes
them even stronger. Sometimes beavers

254
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:33,039
them even stronger. Sometimes beavers
 

255
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,830
them even stronger. Sometimes beavers
build dams in places where people don't

256
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:35,840
build dams in places where people don't
 

257
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,670
build dams in places where people don't
want them. Their dams can flood roads,

258
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:39,680
want them. Their dams can flood roads,
 

259
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,309
want them. Their dams can flood roads,
farmland, or neighborhoods.

260
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:42,319
farmland, or neighborhoods.
 

261
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,189
farmland, or neighborhoods.
When this happens, wildlife experts may

262
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:45,199
When this happens, wildlife experts may
 

263
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,830
When this happens, wildlife experts may
move the beavers or install special

264
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:47,840
move the beavers or install special
 

265
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,990
move the beavers or install special
pipes in the dam to control the water

266
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:51,000
pipes in the dam to control the water
 

267
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,390
pipes in the dam to control the water
flow. Even so, many people have come to

268
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:54,400
flow. Even so, many people have come to
 

269
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,870
flow. Even so, many people have come to
appreciate the good things that beaver

270
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:56,880
appreciate the good things that beaver
 

271
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,790
appreciate the good things that beaver
dams do. Some communities even protect

272
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:00,800
dams do. Some communities even protect
 

273
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,150
dams do. Some communities even protect
beavers and work to live alongside them.

274
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,160
beavers and work to live alongside them.
 

275
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,469
beavers and work to live alongside them.
Their dams help bring wetlands, improve

276
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:08,479
Their dams help bring wetlands, improve
 

277
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,029
Their dams help bring wetlands, improve
water quality, and provide homes for

278
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,039
water quality, and provide homes for
 

279
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,469
water quality, and provide homes for
many animals. To sum it up, beavers

280
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:14,479
many animals. To sum it up, beavers
 

281
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,589
many animals. To sum it up, beavers
build dams to create safe homes. The

282
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:17,599
build dams to create safe homes. The
 

283
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,350
build dams to create safe homes. The
dams slow down water, create ponds, and

284
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:21,360
dams slow down water, create ponds, and
 

285
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,950
dams slow down water, create ponds, and
protect the entrance to the beaver

286
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:23,960
protect the entrance to the beaver
 

287
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,110
protect the entrance to the beaver
lodge. These ponds help beavers find

288
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:27,120
lodge. These ponds help beavers find
 

289
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,469
lodge. These ponds help beavers find
food, stay safe from predators, and

290
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:30,479
food, stay safe from predators, and
 

291
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,830
food, stay safe from predators, and
survive cold winters. But the benefits
