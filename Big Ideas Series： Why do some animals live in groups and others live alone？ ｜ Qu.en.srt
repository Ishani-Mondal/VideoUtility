00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:02,360
important is protection from
 

81
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,109
important is protection from
predators. In a group, individual

82
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:05,119
predators. In a group, individual
 

83
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,590
predators. In a group, individual
animals are less likely to be singled

84
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:07,600
animals are less likely to be singled
 

85
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,190
animals are less likely to be singled
out and attacked. This is known as the

86
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,200

increases the chances of detecting a
 

103
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,949
increases the chances of detecting a
predator early. When one member senses a

104
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:36,959
predator early. When one member senses a
 

105
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,309
predator early. When one member senses a
threat, it can alert the others.

106
00:02:40,309 --> 00:02:40,319
threat, it can alert the others.
 

107
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,509

hunting. Some predators, such as lions,

114
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:54,959
hunting. Some predators, such as lions,
 

115
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,150
hunting. Some predators, such as lions,
wolves, and orcas, hunt in groups to

116
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:58,160
wolves, and orcas, hunt in groups to
 

117
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,910
wolves, and orcas, hunt in groups to
take down larger or faster prey. Each

Social groups also help with raising

124
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,080
Social groups also help with raising
 

125
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,670
Social groups also help with raising
young. In many species, group members

126
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:15,680
young. In many species, group members
 

127
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,470
young. In many species, group members
assist with protecting and feeding the

128
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:19,480
assist with protecting and feeding the
 

129
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,990
assist with protecting and feeding the
offspring. Elephants, for example, form

130
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:23,000
offspring. Elephants, for example, form
 

131
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,070
offspring. Elephants, for example, form
close-knit matriarchal herds where

132
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,080
close-knit matriarchal herds where
 

133
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,949
close-knit matriarchal herds where
females help each other raise calves.

134
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:30,959
females help each other raise calves.
 

135
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,990
females help each other raise calves.

increased competition for food and
 

153
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:06,949
increased competition for food and
resources. In larger groups, there may

154
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:06,959
resources. In larger groups, there may
 

155
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,830
resources. In larger groups, there may
not be enough to go around. This can

00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:28,880
increase the transmission of parasites,
 

169
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,150
increase the transmission of parasites,
bacteria, and

170
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:31,160
bacteria, and
 

171
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,710
bacteria, and
viruses. For example, in primate groups,

172
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:34,720
viruses. For example, in primate groups,
 

173
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,590

competition for

180
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:45,080
competition for
 

181
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,629
competition for
mates. In many social animals, only the

182
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:48,639
mates. In many social animals, only the
 

183
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,950

dominant individuals are allowed to

184
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:50,960
dominant individuals are allowed to
 

185
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,710
