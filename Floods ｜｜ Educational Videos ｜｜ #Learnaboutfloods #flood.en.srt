00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:16,910
what is a flood
a flood is a natural occurrence in which

8
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:16,920
a flood is a natural occurrence in which
 

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,550
a flood is a natural occurrence in which
land that is usually dry becomes over

10
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:19,560
land that is usually dry becomes over
 

11
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,370
land that is usually dry becomes over
saturated with water

12
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:22,380
saturated with water
 

13
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,550
saturated with water
this simply means that dry land gets

14
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:25,560
this simply means that dry land gets
 

15
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,550
this simply means that dry land gets
covered with water

16
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:28,560
covered with water
 

17
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,849

heavy rainfall
 

25
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,290
heavy rainfall
when it rains for long periods of time

26
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:42,300
when it rains for long periods of time
 

27
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,569
when it rains for long periods of time
and the land is unable to drain the

28
00:00:44,569 --> 00:00:44,579
and the land is unable to drain the
 

29
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,150

prevalent in low drainage areas
 

121
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,630
prevalent in low drainage areas
these floods are very dangerous because

122
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:53,640
these floods are very dangerous because
 

123
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,330
these floods are very dangerous because
they occur with little to no warning and

124
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:56,340
they occur with little to no warning and
 

125
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,070
they occur with little to no warning and
therefore there can be little to no
