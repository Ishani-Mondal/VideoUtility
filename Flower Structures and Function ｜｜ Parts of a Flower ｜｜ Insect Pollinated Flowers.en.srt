00:00:26,349 --> 00:00:26,359
so new plants can grow in this video we
 

17
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:30,150
so new plants can grow in this video we
will explore the parts of a flower

18
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:30,160
will explore the parts of a flower
 

19
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,549
will explore the parts of a flower
this is a

petal petals are often colorful and
 

23
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,030
petal petals are often colorful and
conspicuous petals attract pollinators

24
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:38,040
conspicuous petals attract pollinators
 

25
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,630
conspicuous petals attract pollinators
such as insects birds and

nect the nect of a flower is a special
 

31
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,389
nect the nect of a flower is a special
part that makes nectar a sweet liquid

32
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:52,399
part that makes nectar a sweet liquid
 

33
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,029
part that makes nectar a sweet liquid
the nectar is usually found at the base

like bees butterflies and hummingbirds
 

39
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,950
like bees butterflies and hummingbirds
which come to the flower to drink the

and other parts of the plant now let's
 

103
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,350
and other parts of the plant now let's
take a look at the pistol this is the
