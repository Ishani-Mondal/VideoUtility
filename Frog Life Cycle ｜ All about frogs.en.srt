31
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,229
here's a quick fun fact tree frogs have
sticky feet because they secrete mucus

32
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:50,239
sticky feet because they secrete mucus
 

33
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,069

the mucus allows them to stick more
 

35
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,430
the mucus allows them to stick more
easily to the tree as they move around
