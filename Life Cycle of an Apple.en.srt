hi there are some things that are

00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,550
hi there are some things that are
quintessential to the fall season

4

quintessential to the fall season

quintessential to the fall season
and one of them

00:00:08,549 --> 00:00:08,559
and one of them
 

7
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:13,910
and one of them
is the abundance of apples

8
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:13,920

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,630

today let's think about the life cycle

10
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:16,640
today let's think about the life cycle
 

11
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,670
today let's think about the life cycle
of an apple

12
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:19,680

 

13
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,269

the life of an apple starts as a seed

14
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:25,279

 

15
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,150

those seeds are planted in soil where

16
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:28,160
those seeds are planted in soil where
 

17
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,150
those seeds are planted in soil where
they will begin to grow

18
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:32,160

 

19
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,790

after some time the seeds will emerge

20
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:34,800
after some time the seeds will emerge
 

21
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,430
after some time the seeds will emerge
from the soil as sprouts

22
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:39,440

 

23
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,630

after three to five years buds will form

24
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:42,640
after three to five years buds will form
 

25
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,549
after three to five years buds will form
on the tree

26
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:46,559

 

27
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,150

the buds will then create blossoms

28
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:52,160

 

29
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,709

these beautiful blossoms attract

30
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:54,719
these beautiful blossoms attract
 

31
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,069
these beautiful blossoms attract
pollinators like bees to the apple tree

32
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:00,079

 

33
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,950

after about 10 days the blossoms will

34
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:02,960
after about 10 days the blossoms will
 

35
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,070
after about 10 days the blossoms will
fall off the tree and apples will begin

36
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:06,080
fall off the tree and apples will begin
 

37
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,670
fall off the tree and apples will begin
to form in their place

38
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:09,680
to form in their place
 

39
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,950
to form in their place
soon the apple tree will be full of ripe

40
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:12,960
soon the apple tree will be full of ripe
 

41
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,990
soon the apple tree will be full of ripe
fruit ready for picking

42
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,000

 

43
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,469

then you can head over to the orchard
