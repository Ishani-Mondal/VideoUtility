appear in different shapes and this is
 

73
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,709
appear in different shapes and this is
what we refer to as the phases of the

Earth solar eclipses can only happen

84
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:04,880
Earth solar eclipses can only happen
 

85
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,270
Earth solar eclipses can only happen
during the new moon phase because it is

86
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:07,280
during the new moon phase because it is
 

87
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,190
during the new moon phase because it is
the only time that the Moon is between

88
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:10,200
the only time that the Moon is between
 

89
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,270
the only time that the Moon is between
the Sun and the Earth the second phase

the Sun and the Earth the second phase
 

91
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,030
the Sun and the Earth the second phase
in the mooner cycle is called the waxing

92
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:16,040
in the mooner cycle is called the waxing
 

93
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,589
in the mooner cycle is called the waxing
Cresent the moon will appear with a thin

94
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:19,599
Cresent the moon will appear with a thin
 

95
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,070
Cresent the moon will appear with a thin
slice of light in the shape of a

slice of light in the shape of a
 

97
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,470
slice of light in the shape of a
crescent at this point in the lunar

98
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480
crescent at this point in the lunar
 

99
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,229
crescent at this point in the lunar
cycle the moon appears to be growing

100
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:27,239
cycle the moon appears to be growing
 

101
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,309
cycle the moon appears to be growing
hence the term wax and Crescent

102
00:02:31,309 --> 00:02:31,319
hence the term wax and Crescent
 

103
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,390
hence the term wax and Crescent
the third phase in the lunar cycle is

104
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:33,400
the third phase in the lunar cycle is
 

105
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,070
the third phase in the lunar cycle is
called the first

106
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:35,080
called the first
 

107
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,350
called the first
quarter the Crescent in the second phase

108
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:38,360
quarter the Crescent in the second phase
 

109
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,830
quarter the Crescent in the second phase
would have gotten thicker revealing

110
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:40,840
would have gotten thicker revealing
 

111
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,149
would have gotten thicker revealing
about half of the Moon by this

112
00:02:44,149 --> 00:02:44,159
about half of the Moon by this
 

113
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,350
about half of the Moon by this
point some people refer to the Moon as a

114
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:47,360
point some people refer to the Moon as a
 

115
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,790
point some people refer to the Moon as a
half moon but the more accurate term to

116
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:49,800
half moon but the more accurate term to
 

117
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,190
half moon but the more accurate term to
use is first quarter since the Moon is

118
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:53,200
use is first quarter since the Moon is
 

119
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,149
use is first quarter since the Moon is
one quarter of the way through its

cycle the fourth phase of the lunar
 

123
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,910
cycle the fourth phase of the lunar
cycle is called the waxin gibbus the

124
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:01,920
cycle is called the waxin gibbus the
 

125
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,710
cycle is called the waxin gibbus the
word gibbus means swollen and the word

waxin means growing so in this phase the
 

129
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,550
waxin means growing so in this phase the
moon appears to be growing even more

130
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:10,560
moon appears to be growing even more
 

131
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,350

00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:30,360
its orbit around the Earth
 

147
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,830
its orbit around the Earth
this is the only time that there can be

148
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:32,840
this is the only time that there can be
 

149
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,550
this is the only time that there can be
a lunar eclipse because it is the only

a lunar eclipse because it is the only
 

151
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,350
a lunar eclipse because it is the only
time the Earth's Shadow would fall on
